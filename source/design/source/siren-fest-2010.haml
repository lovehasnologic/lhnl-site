  For the tenth summer in a row, the
  %em Village Voice
  unleashed a day of music upon the masses at Coney Island in the form of Siren
  Fest. And for the third year in a row, I was happy to join forces with the
  %em Voice
  and

  to make sure the entire city of New York knew that Coney Island was the place
  to be on July 17th, 2010.

%p
  For the 2010 logo, we focused less on the year itself and more on the fact
  that this was the fest&rsquo;s 10th anniversary. I created a logotype that
  emphasized the anniversary and worked it seamlesly into the stunning backdrop
  that Paul illustrated for the occassion.

  With the logo completed, the whirlwind began, as we pushed it out to ads,
  t-shirts, postcards, posters, artist laminates and the final piece, the
  year&rsquo;s artist guide. In keeping with tradition, for the third year in a
  row we found ourselves sending last minute changes to the printer&rsquo;s
  hours before the presses started running, and looking back, we&rsquo;d want it
  no other way.

  Here&rsquo;s to figuring out how to work a 20 into the Siren logo.
