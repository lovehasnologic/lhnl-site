  fresh young faces that brought you the insanely catchy

  but you may not know that they&rsquo;ve continued to make music over the

  With the input of the band, and working closely with the development team, we
  identified a set of goals for the new site design: tie it into the new album

  and after a few passes of the baton, had completed the quickest redesign
  we&rsquo;d ever done. The team couldn&rsquo;t have been happier with the
  results.
