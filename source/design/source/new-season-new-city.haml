  Elizabeth Weiss is the wife of a minor league hockey player. As such, she
  finds herself moving around the country each time her husband is transferred
  or when she travels with the team. With most of the teams in secondary/third
  tier markets, Yelp was no use to her as she searched for things to do in her
  new surroundings. That&rsquo;s when she decided to build New Season New City,
  a resource for the Hockey Nomads crisscrossing the country, powered by
  recommendations coming directly from the group it was targeting.

  At its heart, the site is a recommendation engine powered by the community.
  Other hockey families recommend their favorite things in their team&rsquo;s
  market. Businesses can be rated, reviewed and favorited. Where New Season New
  City separates itself is in its browsing mechanism. Rather than categorizing
  everything at the top level by business type, New Season New City organizes
  all of the businesses on the site by the team they are associated with. When
  you find yourself traveling to a new team&rsquo;s region, you simply click
  their name and begin filtering the businesses in that region based on your
  interests.

  I worked with Elizabeth to perfect the browsing process. From there, a visual
  identity was developed for the site and a back end was built out to support
  the community being targeted. We also made sure the site was flexible enough
  so that it could slowly be scaled to additional leagues (and eventually be
  scaled out to additional sports as well).
