  Our love of progressive politics is equaled by our affection for well-produced
  entertainment. That&rsquo;s why we couldn&rsquo;t say no to

  when they approached us about doing the promotional flyers for their second
  annual end-of-summer film festival. The festival,

  focused on the impact that military action around the globe has on human life,
  the economy, and the planet.

  Because the budget for the project was low and most of the reproduction would
  be done utilizing the resources available, the flyer was limited to a single
  color that would translate best on a photocopier. The irony of printing a
  large number of flyers to promote a film festival highlighting environmental
  destruction at the hands of war was not lost on us, so we made the flyer as
  small as possible, fitting two-up on a letter-sized sheet of paper. The flyer
  is small but it packs a punch, with a linocut-inspired graphic treatment and a
  broadside-influenced layout.
