  For their final show, we worked with The Minus Scale to create a memorable gig
  poster that they could have screen printed to commemorate the event. We had a
  great time with texture and transformation as gravel became a starry sky,
  torn-up fashion magazines became approachable faces, woodblocks became a city
  skyline and some circles we drew with a marker became the moon shooting out
  its dim light in the night.
