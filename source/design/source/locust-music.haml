  I worked with Chicago record label Locust Music to rebuild their site from
  the ground up. Moving from a fragile, outdated CMS to a more flexible solution
  allowed us to rethink the label&rsquo;s content structure as much as we were
  rethinking the design. I wanted to link all of the site&rsquo;s content back
  to the relevant artist and more easily share related artist content on blog
  entries, artist pages, release pages and anywhere else it made sense. I
  worked with the label to develop a new online ordering system that could
  support digital releases alongside physical goods, and developed a web-based
  system to securely deliver promotional materials to writers and radio
  stations.
