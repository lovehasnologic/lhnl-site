  The
  %em Village Voice&rsquo;s
  Siren Fest is a summer tradition, as music fans from across the city pack up
  some lunch, slather on the sunscreen, and hop on the F train to Coney Island
  for a day full of the best independent music that can fit on two stages. I was
  super excited to work with the
  %em Village Voice
  and

  once again on the identity for the 9th happening of the festival.

  Things started off on the right foot with another amazing illustration from
  Paul, a visual feat, simultaneously spastic with its explosion of shapes but
  still easy to look at, built around a basic color palette. With the
  illustration complete, I set about putting together a great logo to match it.
  This time pulling inspiration from the vintage boardwalk signage scattered
  all around Coney.

  Once the logo was completed, we set out to handle a constant rush of
  advertisements, t-shirts, postcards, posters, rack toppers, letterhead, and
  more. It was quite a feat, culminating in a final push to put the finishing
  touches on everything just weeks after I relocated to Chicago.

  As I look toward next year&rsquo;s 10th anniversary of this Brooklyn
  tradition, I'm already thinking of great ideas to visually celebrate a
  decade of music and fun on the boardwalk.
