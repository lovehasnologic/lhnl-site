  I&rsquo;ve been working with the Chicago Independent Radio Project since
  their 2007 founding. A large part of the group&rsquo;s time is spent on their
  online radio station, found at
  = succeed "." do
    = link_to "CHIRPradio.org", "http://chirpradio.org/"
  While they work toward lowering the barriers to low-power FM access
  nationwide, they use their online station to spread the spirit of truly
  independent, community-centered radio. With years behind the original launch
  and armed with feedback and user analytics, I set out to develop the second
  version of their flagship station site.

  %figure.figure--mockup.figure--phone
    = lazy_image_tag "/assets/images/work/chirpradio-phone.jpg", 600, 937, "CHIRP Radio on a phone"

  With their audience increasingly accessing the site through mobile and
  touch-based devices (a number that rose monthly) I knew the new version would
  have to respond to all environments. Work was done to replace all Flash-based
  elements with HTML5 alternatives that would work on mobile devices lacking
  Flash support.

%p
  A large area of listener confusion had been the separation of the
  group&rsquo;s blog from their main site, so the two were merged into one. The
  content was organized and simplified as well. Visually, the site  was brought
  in line with the new identity that I&rsquo;d been rolling out in the
  station&rsquo;s mobile apps as well as on their mailing list.

%p
  Finally, I worked with CHIRP to develop new site functionality for listeners,
  including the ability for users to create accounts and track favorite songs,
  community forums to foster discussion and debate, and a more flexible and
  feature-rich store infrastructure. The back end was rebuilt from the ground up
  to support the way the group&rsquo;s more than 200 volunteers needed to access
  and manage the site&rsquo;s content.

  = lazy_image_tag "/assets/images/work/chirpradio-playlist.jpg", 1500, 675, "Detail View of the tracklist"

%p
  The biggest challenge in developing the new back end was establishing the
  infrastructure needed to support a network of sites. The launch of the new
  CHIRP Radio website also included launches of a site used by the group&rsquo;s
  volunteer base and a dedicated site for
  = succeed "." do
    = link_to "CHIRP&rsquo;s annual record fair", "http://lovehasnologic.com/our-work/detail/chirp-record-fair"
  All sites are managed through the same back-end system and share data and user
  accounts. This new infrastructure will also make it much easier to roll out
  new sites for future CHIRP events and initiatives.
