  The documentarians who created Glacier Film Partners approached us with the
  job of visualizing their film style in a single mark. We developed a logo
  using handmade textures created through a variety of techniques: woodblock
  prints, burnt film and scratched paper. It was important for us to capture the
  handmade feel of the group&rsquo;s films. Once we created the logo, we applied
  it to a stationary set with the addition of a 4.75&quot; square mailing label
  that could double as a CD/DVD insert.
