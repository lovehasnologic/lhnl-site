            I&rsquo;ve been writing HTML for 18 years and CSS for 13 years. I
            lived through the browser wars, watched the web embrace the
            standards movement, was witness to the rise of Content Management
            Systems and am currently enjoying the huge jump forward the web is
            witnessing due to the advancements in HTML5, CSS3 and working
            solutions for real embedded type on the web. Those advancements
            require equal progress in the way we approach our work.

            No longer is it alright to simply design a page in Photoshop and
            call yourself a web designer. Our process needs to support design
            systems, rather than designed pages, and our work is not done until
            it is rendered in a browser window.
          %p
            In discussions of web design, too often the focus is on the visual
            aspect of the design. However, the visual layer is just one of three
            layers that make a truly effective web site design. You need to
            ensure the interaction of the site is intuitive and pleasing; That
            you create little moments of pleasure that transcend color and
            typography. You need to ensure the execution of the site takes into
            account all the constraints of the modern web like unknown screen
            sizes, variable internet connection speeds, user accessibility
            restrictions and an ever growing collection of browser technologies
            (to name just a few).
          %p
            Designing for the web is about embracing the constraints of the
            medium and using them to your advantage. I often refer to this as
            designing for failure. When you think you have the perfect design
            solution is when the real work begins. That is when you begin to
            work through all of the ways that the fragility of the web can (and
            will) break your design and strengthen the system to live up to
            stand up to even the worst case scenarios.
